Exploitation of HeartBleed vuln

1) ./setup.sh
OPTIONNAL : you can change the config in config.sh, otherwise, it's not recommended.
2) Fill the targets file with vulnerable servers.
3) ./always targets.txt

You can manually add your targets by adding your IPs to targets.txt (format ip:port) like 192.168.0.1:80
Please note that 443 is default.
There's a script BLEED_ADD_TARGETS_SCRIPT who add IPs from source inputed. (see BLEED_SOURCE_FILE)



========= Explanations =========
In ./data are all the usable data, like target list.
In ./logs are all the logs from exploit script.
In ./in are all file that we can get data incoming from there "like source code of html page".


Scripts are using ./config.sh to import config from config.sh file located on project root.
