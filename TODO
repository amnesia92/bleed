TODO

1) Test script
The actual script does not permit to say if the target has leaked, or not.
Make a script based on Heartbleed.py that tests and returns a value depending on target's vuln.

2) Regexp creds
Find a way to extract all creds or "may be cool" value from verbose logs.
That will make it cool and better for the BLEED_SCREEN_SCRIPT to display what we gained.
